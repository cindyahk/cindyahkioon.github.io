            <p>WELCOME!</p>
            <p>Hi, I am Cindy and I come from Mauritius, but currently living in Beijing. </p>

            <p>
              My passion does not lie in only creating or designing beautiful interfaces but rather in making them user friendly and easily
              accessible to people. It was not until I started my first front end development job that I really realised the importance of a good
              user interface with great user experience. I have been constantly learning ever since and I am currently a FreeCodeCamp student. Check out some of recent works on github and codepen.
            </p>

            <p>I would love to work in interesting projects, and in a team where I can not only learn from  but also share my knowledge as well
            as contribute.</p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">
              <p>A user interface is like a joke. If you have to explain it, it is not that good.</p>
