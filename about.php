      <p><b>Hi, I am Cindy and I am a front end developer from Mauritius, but currently living in Beijing. </b></p>
      <h4>Background</h4>
      <p>
        I was born and raised in Mauritius, a small multi-cultural island in the Indian Ocean. I later moved on to Beijing China for studies, and worked
      in Zhuhai for about two years. I am now currently working in Beijing.
      </p>
      <h4>What I Love</h4>
      <p>
        My passion does not lie in only creating or designing beautiful interfaces but rather in making them user friendly and easily
        accessible to people. It was not until I started my first front end development job that I really realised the importance of a good
        user interface with great user experience. I have been constantly learning ever since and I am currently a FreeCodeCamp student. Check out some of recent works on github and codepen.
      </p>

      <p>I would love to work in interesting projects, and in a team where I can not only learn from  but also share my knowledge as well
      as contribute.</p>

        <p>A user interface is like a joke. If you have to explain it, it is not that good.</p>
